# Overview of Machine Learning Agents

## Libraries

- **crewAI:** For creating agents. Main dependency.
- **smolagents:** Some tools like local Python executor will be used from this library.
- **Langchain:** Some tools to be used.

## Workflow and Modules

- **Machine Learning Utils:** Some utilities to be used in the process.
- **Tools:** Tools based on the utilities.
- **Tests:** Tests to be run before a task is completed.
- **Agents:** Agents to be used in the process.
- **Tasks:** Tasks to be completed.
- **Crews:** The crews using the agents and tasks.

## Tasks

- [ ] Integrate tools from smolagents. crewAI is already compatible with langchain.
- [ ] Learn about memory management in crewAI.
- [ ] Create utilities for machine learning.
- [ ] Create tools using the utilities.
- [ ] Create tests for the tasks.
- [ ] Create agents, tasks and crews.
