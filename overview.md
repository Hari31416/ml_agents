# Overview of Machine Learning Agents

The user will provide the features and targets. The agents will to every step of the machine learning process and will return the best model.

## Make it Simple

We will start by making some assumptions about the dataset. The goal is to create a library that is simple, yet modular. Later, we can add more features.

### Assumptions

- Heavy feature engineering is not required. The agent should create some features but user should not depend on it.
- The data is somewhat clean and does not require heavy preprocessing. A completely clean dataset is not necessary, the agent will do some preprocessing.
- The data is in tabular format.
- It is supervised learning. Learning tasks can be:
  - Binary classification
  - Multi-class classification
  - Regression
- No time-series data.
- No textual data.

## Libraries

- **crewAI:** For creating agents. Main dependency.
- **smolagents:** Some tools like local Python executor will be used from this library.
- **Langchain:** Some tools to be used.

## Workflow and Modules

- **Machine Learning Utils:** Some utilities to be used in the process.
- **Tools:** Tools based on the utilities.
- **Tests:** Tests to be run before a task is completed.
- **Agents:** Agents to be used in the process.
- **Tasks:** Tasks to be completed.
- **Crew:** The crew using the agents and tasks.

### `ml_utils`

Utilities for:

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Missing value handling (imputation strategies: mean/median/mode, drop columns/rows)
  - Categorical encoding (one-hot, label, ordinal, target encoding)
  - Feature scaling (standardization, normalization)
  - Outlier detection & handling (IQR, Z-score)
- **Feature Engineering:** Polynomial features, combining two or more features, other transformations on single features like log, exponential, time features.
  - Polynomial feature creation
  - Interaction terms
  - Log and Power transformations
  - Date/time feature decomposition
- **EDA:**
  - Summary statistics
  - correlation
  - multicollinearity.
- **Feature Selection:**
  - Variance thresholding
  - RFE
  - mutual information
  - high outlier/null values.
- **Model Development:**
  - Basic model templates (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, etc.)
  - Metric calculators (accuracy, F1, RMSE, RÂ²)
  - Cross-validation strategies
  - Hyperparameter grids

### `ml_tests`

- **Data Tests:**

  - Missing value check
  - Data type validation
  - Class imbalance detection
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature correlation analysis

- **Model Tests:**

  - Baseline accuracy check
  - Cross-validation consistency
  - Overfitting detection (train-test gap)
  - Feature importance sanity check
  - Prediction distribution analysis

- **Implementation:**
  - Returns (success: bool, message: str)
  - Threshold configurations for warnings/errors

### `ml_tools`

Most of the important methods in the `ml_utils` module will be converted into tools.
